# HyprerionDev-Task-24 Capstone project IV Show Case website


## What this is and what this project is for.
I created a ShowCase website project to show my hobbies and like, using HTML, SCSS and Javascript as well as JQuery functionality
What this project does is that it allows a user to browse through the site and save specific items on the sweets page and saved items will be displayed on the saved for later page. It also allows users to like images and show and Hide images on the gammers page.
